England will take San Marino, the world's worst national team in Fifa's rankings,
'very seriously' as the Three Lions have yet to qualify for the World Cup, says boss Gareth Southgate.

England need one point from their final group game to ensure qualification.

San Marino are 210th - bottom - in the world rankings and have lost all nine group games
in qualifying, conceding 36 times and scoring just once.
